# N-Body Simulation

## Introduction

This project simulates the motion of multiple bodies (N-bodies) under the influence of gravitational forces, fluid friction, and collision physics. It is implemented as an HTML5 web application, using CSS for styling and JavaScript for the simulation logic.

## Features

- **Dynamic Object Addition**: You can add an unlimited number of objects, constrained only by your computer's processing power.
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English, French, Spanish, and German, with additional languages planned for future releases.
- **Special Thanks**: Appreciation to Arthur Loubeau for contributing the Spanish translation.
