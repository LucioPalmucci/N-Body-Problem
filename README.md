# N-Body Simulation

### Overview

This project simulates the motion of N-bodies subject to gravitational attraction, fluid friction and their collision physics. It's an HTML5 web page with CSS and JavaScript back code.

> You can add as many objects as you like, as long as you're not limited by the computer's capacity. \
> The project is available in English, French, Spanish, and German (with more soon). \
> Thanks to Arthur Loubeau for the Spanish translation.
