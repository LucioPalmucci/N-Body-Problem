# N-Body Simulation

### Overview

This project simulates the motion of N-bodies subject to gravitational attraction, fluid friction and their collision physics. It's an HTML5 web page with CSS and JavaScript back code.

You can add as many objects as you like, as long as you're not limited by the computer's capacity.
