# N-Body Simulation

## Introduction

This project simulates the motion of multiple bodies (N-bodies) under the influence of gravitational forces, electromagnetic forces, fluid friction, and collision physics. It is implemented as an HTML5 web application, using CSS for styling and JavaScript for the simulation logic.

## Features

- **Dynamic Object Addition**: You can add an unlimited number of objects, constrained only by your computer's processing power.
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English, French, Spanish, and German, Italian, Latin with additional languages planned for future releases.
- **Special Thanks**: Appreciation to Arthur Loubeau for contributing the Spanish translation.

## Example
